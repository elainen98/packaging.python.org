Packages are the hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation to avoid collisions between 
module names and can be downloaded by PyPI through the pip tool which is used to install and manage software packages written in Python. 
-	Python package installing command:
	
	pip install some-package-name

-	Python package removing command 
	
	pip uninstall some-package-name

PyPI, also known as Python Package Index is the official third-party software raspatory for Python. 
It contains over 235,000 python packages and is free for public use, hence many package managers has PyPI as 
their default source for packages and their dependencies. Although PyPI is popular in a global scale, it is not the only 
software repository for python as businesses, private organizations and private projects often opt for a more private way of 
sharing libraries and packages. Therefore, CloudRepo would often be their best choice due to their cloud based and private artifact 
raspatory which functions the same way as PyPI to the users. 

Although PyPI has immensely in popularity over the years, it is not the only index of Python packages. There are multiple competitors 
in the market that play a similar role such as Pillow, Matplotlib, Numpy, OpenCV Python, Request, Pandas and many more. 

For example, Pandas is a fast, demonstrative, and adjustable python software package that offers intuitive data-structures which users can easily 
manipulate any type of data such as â€“ structured or time-series data with this amazing package.
-	Series and DataFrames to easily organize, explore, represent, and manipulate data.
-	Perfect organization and data labelling with Smart alignment and indexing features
-	Special features to handle missing data or value with a proper measure. 
-	Provides clean code for easy accessibility without programming knowledge 
-	Built-in tools that allows both reading and writing data in different web services, data-structure, and databases 
-	Can support JSON, Excel, CSV, HDF5, and many other formats as well as merge different databases at a time with Pandas.
